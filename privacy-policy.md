## 1. Data Storage and Processing
All personal and financial data you enter in **Balory** is stored **exclusively on your device**.  
Balory operates entirely **offline** – no servers, cloud storage, or third-party APIs are used to process or store your information.

Your transactions, accounts, budgets, and all related data remain **private and fully under your control**.  
No automatic synchronization with cloud services takes place unless you explicitly use a local export or import function (e.g. manual backup).

Balory complies with the **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (revDSG)**.

## 2. Permissions and Access
Balory only requests permissions strictly necessary for its functionality:

- **Notifications:** Used solely for local reminders (e.g. expense tracking).  
  Notification content never includes sensitive data such as account balances or transaction details.  
  Notifications are only activated after your explicit consent.

- **Camera & Media Library:** Used exclusively for attaching receipts or documents to transactions.  
  Images remain stored locally and are never uploaded or shared.

No other device data (e.g. contacts, location, calendar) is accessed.

---

## 3. In-App Purchases
Balory offers optional one-time purchases (e.g. *Founders Edition*).  
These purchases are handled directly through the **App Store** or **Google Play** and are subject to their respective privacy policies.  
Balory itself does **not** collect or process any payment information.

Purchase status (license validation) is stored securely on your device and managed locally.

## 4. Analytics and Tracking
Balory does **not** use analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, or tracking tools.  
No usage statistics are collected, and no data is shared with third parties.

Your app usage remains completely private and anonymous.

## 5. Your Rights and Data Control
You have full control over your data at any time:

- All entries can be deleted individually or completely via the in-app reset function.  
- Uninstalling the app removes all stored data automatically.  
- Backups (if created) remain only where you stored them (e.g. your device storage or manual export location).

Balory does not keep or restore data outside your local device.
