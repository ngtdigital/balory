## 1. Data Processing and Storage
All your financial data is stored exclusively locally on your device. Balory does not use servers, cloud sync, or transmit data to external services.

Your transactions, accounts, categories, and all other financial information remain completely under your control on your smartphone or tablet.

No automatic synchronization with cloud services takes place. Your data is private and accessible only to you.

Balory complies with applicable data protection regulations, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (revDSG).

Notification content does not contain sensitive data such as account balances, transaction amounts, or account names.

Notifications serve exclusively for general reminders (e.g., “Have you recorded expenses today?”).

Camera and photo library permissions are used only for attaching receipts to transactions.
