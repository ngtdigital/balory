## What is Balory?

Balory is a personal finance app that helps you understand where your money goes – without giving your data to anyone.

The app runs fully offline. Your transactions, balances, budgets and notes are stored only on your device. There is no login, no server, and no tracking.

Balory is designed for people who want structure and clarity without complexity.

Available for iOS and Android.
